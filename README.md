[![Deploy to Azure](http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png)](https://azuredeploy.net/)

## Included Azure Resources
Azure Hosting Plan 
Azure Website

## Description
Current Umbraco version of deployed Package: 7.4.2
This is the simplest deployment package of Umbraco to Azure. It only creates a Resource Group, Azure Hosting Plan and Azure website then deploy an Umbraco package that I created. 

The package deployed is a custom package I created and copied to a blob storage account. You can deploy your own by providing your package storage location parameters during deployment.
